Folders ending in "Copy" contain the data collected from disruption tests of rectangular implants placed in the femora of male wistar rats.

Notes: All implants should have been collected from 1 of 6 time points (5,9,14,28,84,168 days). Times outside of this range should if close (difference of 1 should be added to closest time point)

The first 2-3 numbers indicate the sample number
The following character can be (L/R) indicating which limb the implant was placed (Left/Right)
The next character after that can be (L/M) indicating the side the femur being tested (lateral/medial)
The presense of S at the end of the string indicates that testing was in shear, otherwise it was in tension
Finally this can be followed by a hypenated number which indicates on which test trial the sample failed, which was sometimes required when the fishing line used to test the implant failed.

In the legend implants are labeled as A or B
A is the BAE implant (Blasted Acid Etched)
B is the BAE+DCD implant (Blasted Acid Etched with Discrete Crystalline Deposition of calcium phosphate
